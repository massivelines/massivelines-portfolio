There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Look, last night was a mistake.

Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! You know, I was God once.
