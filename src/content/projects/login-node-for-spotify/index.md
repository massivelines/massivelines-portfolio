Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may beâ€¦
