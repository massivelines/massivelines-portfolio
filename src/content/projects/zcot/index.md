The key to victory is discipline, and that means a well made bed. You will practice until you can make your bed in your sleep. It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus.

But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?
